## Carbon Dioxide Uptake in Grass Plants - Data

The CO2 uptake of six plants from Quebec and six plants from Mississippi was measured at several levels of ambient CO^2 concentration. Half the plants of each type were chilled overnight before the experiment was conducted.

Polynomial regression was used to fit a model for each of the four Location - Treatment conditions.

- Mississippi - Chilled
- Mississippi - Nonchilled
- Quebec - Chilled
- Quebec - Nonchilled
